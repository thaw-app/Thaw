/// Writing end of the ThawControls state channel.
///
/// An appex is sandboxed and Thaw is not, so the controls learn whether the
/// hidden section is revealed or Zen Mode is on through the shared
/// A7CKWF99ML.com.stonerl.Thaw application group: a small JSON snapshot of the
/// two Bools in the group's UserDefaults suite.
///
/// The channel is one-way. State flows app to appex through the suite, while
/// commands flow appex to app as Darwin notifications, because a defaults write
/// does not wake a running process and a Darwin notification does.
///
/// A stale snapshot can survive a crash, but the first tap sends the toggle
/// verb and the relaunched app republishes the real value. Set up once from
/// AppState; the publisher's lifetime is the app's.
